                            I was a contractor for a local company called Alamark where I built anything from inventory tracking apps to CRM's, for companies ranging from a small landscaping company to a billion dollar international company. Not too long
                            after, I took on a 6 month contract in downtown Dallas. I finished everything in a couple weeks, and they decided they would teach me SQL. I know if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have gotten my first salary job at Sears as
                            a Business Systems Analyst. Thats where I just dove right into programming. One of our first projects was to automate part of the National Claims Center for Sears. That project was the one that made me realize I could do this
                            forever. After my time on that side of Sears, I went to the "more corporate" side where I was more involved in reporting. I had to build reporting websites, SSRS reports, Tableau reports, and DOMO reports. I even made the "How
                            To" video for DOMO to teach all the excecutives how to utilize the service. Then in November of 2018 when Sears filed for bankruptcy, our entire department was laid off. I took a few months off and in January of 2019, I started
                            my new job as a C# / Report Developer at a healthcare staffing company. I am still enjoying my career choice and strive to become better and learn new skills everyday.
